# basic-calc-rust

How to build my stupid calculator:
Go into your shell (powershell, bash, I don't give a monkey's ass)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aldorithms/basic-calc-rust.git
cd basic-calc-rust
rustc main.rs
./main.exe
```

Now input '=' followed by a number, then one of these operator: + - * /
example:

```
= 4.533 * 34
```

If it doesn't work, it's your fault. I don't make mistakes.
Oh I'm sorry, the program failed? When?
No, I mean when did I ask?
